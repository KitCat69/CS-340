How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Using good coding practices for Pyrthon. Consider every use case and my intentions for that program. Making it easy and adaptable for myself and for others to understand. Working this way allowed me to understand how to implenment CRUD for creating, inputting, changing, and deleting information for any size database.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

If I did not undertand something, I researched the solution or reached out to my instructor for assistance. The major difference with this final project was uploading a photo to the dashboard and continuing the functions for buttons and dropdowns.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do many things. From technology to medical, it matters what the scientist does. If I had the opportunity to work on a project like this for a company, I would fall back on this project as a refresher. Having the experience under me allows me to do it better the second time around.
